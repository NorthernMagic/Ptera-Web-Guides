## The Salty Supercharger
I love salt, it has a unique tang to it, that you can't just get. Put it on dishes like Spaghetti and Lasagna, and the flavorscape
just opened up a whole lot wider. You don't want to over do it, so don't think putting more than a tablespoon won't neccessary make things bett-

Oops, wrong type of Sodium. *Stick to the script Luke, no one wants to hear your cooking tips!*

Sodium is an amazing Minecraft mod I think everyone should try out! It's no secret that Minecraft doesn't run, well... Especially if you're on low end or older
hardware. Thankfully, you don't have to live with this, and everyone can gain more performance out of this game we cherish so dearly.

Sodium is a free and open-source (FOSS) rendering optimization mod for people on 1.16 or newer. Its extremely compatible with the rest of the Fabric ecosystem, so its rare to see any conflicts with other mods, party because of its open source nature. So if a mod developer has an issue with their mod regarding Sodium, they can read the source code and work their mod around it, or suggest a change to the Sodium project to fix the incompatibility. Another benefit of Sodium, is the minimal effect on the Vanilla mechanics, making for an authentic gameplay experience with no added extras. Its not uncommon to see 2-3X performance uplift, especially on low end hardware.

*Sourced from Sodium Modrinth page. It shows a massive improvement in fps or frames per second, providing for a smoother gameplay experience.*

Many people on our server actually use Sodium! Bet you didn't know that. If you want even more performance, try pairing it with mods like.

* [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium)
* [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor)
* [FerriteCore](https://modrinth.com/mod/ferrite-core)

If you want graphic changing shaders, pair Sodium with [Iris](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris), an open-source shaders mod for Minecraft! The developers of both projects, actually work together closely, with some even working for both! 

But what about Optifine? The other optimization mod, with shaders built in? 
Call me biased, but Optifine is outdated for most people in my opinion. Its closed source, so mod developers really can't know how to fix things if their mods break
with it. Recently, Optifine has also been slow at pushing updates for new versions of Minecraft. For 1.19.3 as of writing, there is no stable version out yet, even as we are in the Release Candidate stage of 1.19.4. But there is one thing that I will give credit too.

It's filled with features out of the box, and has the gretest shader compatibility out there (Even though Iris is closing that gap quite quickly).

But from a performance standpoint, it lags behind Sodium or comes close to it, and if you install those other mods mentioned, earlier, it lags behind even further. Plus there are tons of more customizable Fabric mods that can recreate the Optifine feature set while giving better performance and optimization. And even then, if you want shaders quickly, just download the [odium + Iris](https://irisshaders.net/download) bundle off of the Iris website.

I'm thankful for Optifine, and no offense to them, but I think Sodium is a better alternative to most people now. With that little rant out of the way
feel free to install it and try it out, if you don't know how to install Fabric or mods in general, read the [Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/NorthernMagic/Ptera-Web-Guides/blob/Contributor/Quickstart%20Guides/Windows%20Quickstart%20Guide.md). It has a neat section on how to install Fabric and configure mods. 

Interested in shaders? Read the [Shaders Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/NorthernMagic/Ptera-Web-Guides/blob/Contributor/Quickstart%20Guides/Windows%20%7C%20Minecraft%20(Java)%20Shaders%20Quickstart.md). It will get you everything you need to get your game looking the best it can be, with the best possible fps.

Sodium really does wonders to one's foo- er game..

Expect another article sometime next week. This is Magic, signing off.
