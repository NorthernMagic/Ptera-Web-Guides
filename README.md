# Ptera Web Guides README

# OUTDATED | Not Maintained 

This Guides Repo is not maintained anymore due to the Ptera community dying down, and there are 100 other guides that say the same thing.
Always try to get firsthand guides from the developers themselves, as they will be the most up to date.

This GitHub repo was made by me (Magic) so the guides can all be centralized. You are getting the latest versions
of these guides, freshly right off the trunk. 

The `Contributor` branch is for people to propose changes to.

The `Final Version` branch reflects the main version of the guides, presented to people.
If you want to just read the guides for help, use this branch.

This github is for you Pteranites! For anyone new, check out Ptera and his amazing community. The Fluffy Wing Fam!

### WANT CHANGES?
This guide is fully open-source. Feel free to fork, rewrite, or do anything YOU think will benefit these guides! Anybody with a GitHub account and a basic knowledge of Markdown can contribute to the guides. Edit away and propose a commit! DM me on the Fluffy Wing Fam Discord so I'm notified of the changes, and can merge them into the main guide.

Please note that we can reject any proposals that we deem not helpful. This is to prevent misinformation and vandalism.
