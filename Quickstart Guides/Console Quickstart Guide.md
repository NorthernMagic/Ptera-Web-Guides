### BUYING AND INSTALLING MINECRAFT (XBOX)

In order to join our server on Xbox, you need to have a copy of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition on your console. 
You also need to have an active Xbox Live Gold or Game Pass subscription for multiplayer.

### JOINING THE SERVER (XBOX)

2b) Once the new DNS address has been put in, make sure your setting are saved. Then open up Minecraft and go into the server menu. Choose any server, I did Pixel Paradise. I recommend a server you don't play on a lot when choosing. It should now bring up a screen telling you to input a `server address` and `server port`. Our server address is `play.ptera.tv`, and the port is `19132`. Toggle add to server list so you won't have to input the IP again in the future.

2c) Fill out this Google [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeEBVKIESOidbwOyYXCdaG4JxFVVfZEXefyW7vQQQHF83sEYQ/viewform?usp=send_form) if you haven't, and DM Ptera or a moderator about you filling it out to ensure you get added.

2d) Clicking on either one of them will log you into our server instantly. 

⚠️ If you get an error saying you aren't on the whitelist, DM a moderator and they will get things sorted out. Try to rejoin after that.

## OTHER BEDROCKCONNECT IPS

Here is a quicklist of IPs for other global locations. Try choosing one closest to you if you'd like. We used the US DNS server in this guide. You can also use BedrockConnect for your Switch or PlayStation if you want a more public DNS. The only difference is joining the server from the menu, as you have to input the IP address and save it.
